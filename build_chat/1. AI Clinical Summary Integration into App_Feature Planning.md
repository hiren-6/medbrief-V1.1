  ### User Input

We need to add an AI feature that processes patient uploaded disease and symptom details and documents to AI powered clinical summary. This feature must be triggered immedietly once patient submits documents/details and book an appointment. Here is the workflow: 1. send designated data from supabase table against each user as soon as user click on submit data in appointment booking step. (I will guide you the location in supabase table to collect all data in JSON structure and then share with AI agent) 2. Along with, share user uploaded documents and its meta data to LLM along with prompt template (System message, user message, instructions, JSON template for returning output) 3. LLM processes data and return output in a strict JSON format only and store in a mentioned supabase table against that respective consultation id, and patient id. Help me first plan such function by analyzing this webapp codebase and suggest implementation strategy, ensuring the production grade and secure features, while also keep in mind, I am newbie in AI app building. I am thinking that this feature should be built in supabase edge function to securely connect with Gemini 2.5 Pro model.

### Planner Response

### High-level architecture

1. **Client → Supabase**  
   • Patient completes the appointment‐booking screen and uploads files.  
   • Front-end writes:  
     a. `appointments` record (incl. consultation ID, patient ID, status)  
     b. `patient_inputs` JSON column containing disease/symptom details  
     c. Files to Supabase Storage (bucket: e.g. `patient_docs/…`)  

2. **Supabase Edge Function (`generate_clinical_summary.ts`)**  
   • Triggered immediately by a **row-level “INSERT” database webhook** on `appointments`.  
   • Reads the newly inserted appointment + joins/queries related tables (or the `patient_inputs` column).  
   • Retrieves Storage file signed URLs + metadata.  
   • Builds a prompt (system / user / instructions / JSON schema).  
   • Calls Gemini 2.5 Pro over HTTPS using the official Google AI SDK with an outbound service key stored in Supabase secrets.  
   • Validates the LLM return against a Zod/JSON-Schema.  
   • Persists the summary JSON to `clinical_summaries` with `consultation_id` & `patient_id`.  
   • Emits an `UPDATE appointments SET status='summary_ready'`.

3. **Back-end security**  
   • Edge Function runs server-side in V8 isolate—no client credentials exposed.  
   • Gemini API key stored via `supabase secrets set GEMINI_KEY=…`.  
   • RLS: only Edge Func has “service-role” key; clients read via RLS-filtered view.  
   • Signed URLs for docs expire in minutes.

### Concrete implementation strategy

| Phase | Owner | Key files / tasks |
|-------|-------|-------------------|
| 1. Schema | DBA | a) Add `clinical_summaries` table (`id`, `consultation_id`, `patient_id`, `summary_json`, `created_at`) <br> b) Ensure `appointments` has `consultation_id`, `patient_id`, status column |
| 2. Edge Function | You | `supabase/functions/generate_clinical_summary.ts` <br> • Boilerplate: `serve(async (req) => { … })` <br> • Parse webhook payload (row). <br> • Fetch patient inputs & Storage file list with `createSignedUrl`. <br> • Compose prompt. <br> • Call Gemini. <br> • Validate & insert result. |
| 3. Trigger | You | SQL: `create trigger trg_ai_summary after insert on appointments for each row execute function edge_fn('generate_clinical_summary');` |
| 4. Front-end | You | In booking flow ([AppointmentScheduler.tsx](cci:7://file:///e:/AI%20Project/App%20Development/Personal%20App/MedBrief%20ai/medbrief%20V1.1/src/components/AppointmentScheduler.tsx:0:0-0:0)): keep current logic, no extra calls needed. Add polling or real-time subscription to `appointments.status`/`clinical_summaries` so UI shows “Summary ready”. |
| 5. Env / Secrets | You | `supabase secrets set GEMINI_KEY=…` |
| 6. Testing | You | a) Unit-test Edge Function with mocked Gemini (nock). <br> b) E2E: create fake appointment via PostgREST, verify summary row created. |

### Prompt template (edge function)

```text
System: You are a clinical‐grade summariser…
User: ${JSON.stringify(patientInputs, null, 2)}
Documents-meta:
${docsMetaList}
Instruction: Return ONLY valid JSON matching this schema:
{
  "chief_complaint": string,
  "history_of_present_illness": string,
  "differential_diagnoses": string[],
  "recommended_tests": string[],
  "urgency_level": "routine" | "urgent" | "emergency"
}
```

### Production-grade & security tips

1. **Schema validation** – use Zod; reject & log if invalid.  
2. **Retries & backoff** – Gemini transient errors (`503`, `429`).  
3. **Observability** – `console.log` w/ structured JSON ➜ Supabase logs; add Slack webhook on failures.  
4. **Cost guardrails** – Token-limit prompt; abort if docs > N MB.  
5. **Versioning** – store `model_version` & `prompt_version` in summary row for auditability.  
6. **PII handling** – Only send minimal data to LLM; redact PHI not required.

### Next steps in this repo

1. Locate booking component & confirm it writes to `appointments`.  
2. Scaffold `supabase/functions/generate_clinical_summary.ts` with empty handler.  
3. Add SQL migration for new table & trigger.  
4. Commit `.env.example` entry for `GEMINI_KEY`.  

I’ll analyse [AppointmentScheduler.tsx](cci:7://file:///e:/AI%20Project/App%20Development/Personal%20App/MedBrief%20ai/medbrief%20V1.1/src/components/AppointmentScheduler.tsx:0:0-0:0), [AppointmentManagement.tsx](cci:7://file:///e:/AI%20Project/App%20Development/Personal%20App/MedBrief%20ai/medbrief%20V1.1/src/components/AppointmentManagement.tsx:0:0-0:0), and existing supabase client code next, then share exact code snippets you can paste. Let me know if this direction matches your expectations!

### User Input

Yes it matches. Before that, first guide me that can we submit patient uploaded documents such as PDFs and images directy to GEMINI 2.5 pro from our supabase table or do I need to parse the data from documents, store in supabase table/temp table and then share with GEMINI 2.5 pro?

### Planner Response

Gemini 2.5 Pro’s API accepts:

1. Text (prompt strings – the usual way).  
2. Image content – supplied either  
   • as a publicly reachable HTTPS URL, or  
   • as base-64 encoded JPEG/PNG bytes in the request JSON.

It does **not** ingest arbitrary binary files such as PDFs or DOCX directly; those must be converted to text or images first.

Recommended pipeline for your app
1. PDFs  
   • Use a server-side extractor inside the Edge Function (e.g. `pdf-parse` or `pdfjs-dist`) to pull plain text.  
   • Optionally chunk & summarise long docs before sending to Gemini to stay within token limits and reduce cost.  

2. Images (lab results, scans, handwritten notes)  
   • No preprocessing needed beyond optional resize/compression.  
   • Create a short-lived signed URL from Supabase Storage **or** read the bytes and include one `inlineData` object per image in the Gemini request.

3. Other formats (DOCX, CSV, etc.)  
   • Convert to text (LibreOffice headless, `mammoth`, etc.) or CSV string.  
   • Then send as part of the prompt.

Why avoid direct PDF upload?
• Gemini would treat it as opaque binary; you’d waste tokens and may hit content-type validation errors.  
• Extracting only the relevant text keeps prompts small and compliant with HIPAA/PII minimisation.

Implementation tip for Supabase Edge Function
```ts
// Example for an image
const { data: { signedUrl } } = await supabase
  .storage.from('patient_docs')
  .createSignedUrl(path, 300);  // 5-min expiry

request.body.contents.push({
  inlineData: {
    mimeType: 'image/png',
    data: Buffer.from(await fetch(signedUrl).then(r => r.arrayBuffer())).toString('base64')
  }
});
```

So:
• Images → send directly (URL/base64).  
• PDFs → extract text, then send.  
• Store the extracted or cleaned text in a temp JSON column if you want auditing or re-processing; otherwise you can keep it in memory during the Edge Function call.

This keeps the workflow secure, cost-efficient, and within Gemini’s input specs.

### User Input

Perfect. Keep this image and pdf related configuration in mind once we being the AI feature development. Now, I will provide you the data that needs to be shared to LLM along with its location across the multiple supabase tables.

First, patient history from 'profile' table in supabase with this columns only: {
  "age": "int",
  "family_history": "string or null",
  "smoking_status": "string",
  "tobacco_use": "string",
  "allergies": "list of strings",
  "alcohol_consumption": "string",
  "exercise_frequency": "string",
  "bmi": "int or float"
}
You may not find age column, but can calculated with Date of birth column data.

Second, patient current symptom details are in 'form_data' column of 'Consultations" table in supabase: {
  "symptoms": "string",
  "allergies": "string or null",
  "medications": "string or null",
  "severity_level": "string",
  "chief_complaint": "string",
  "symptom_duration": "string",
  "chronic_conditions": "string or null",
  "additional_symptoms": "string or null"
}

Third, patient uploaded documents are in 'patient_files' supabase table. Here, against each 'consulatation_id', patient uploads multiple documents and public URL file path is stored in 'file_path' column. Here remember that we need to parse pdf and store the data in this table before sharing with LLM and for image files. function can pick from this column. Use 'file_type' column to determine whether file should be parsed or directly shared with LLM.  Write sql query to update the table structure and RLS policy that accomodate these changes.

Process these instructions first, post that will brainstorm on output JSON structure, medical prompts, user and system prompt templates.

### Planner Response

Below is a ready-to-run migration script (Postgres / Supabase SQL) that

1. Extends `patient_files` so your Edge Function has a place to store extracted PDF text and a flag telling you it has been processed.  
2. Adds the missing foreign-key link to `consultations`.  
3. Tightens RLS so:  
   • the authenticated patient who owns the consultation can read/write their own files,  
   • a clinician (role = `doctor`) assigned to the consultation can read,  
   • the Edge Function (running with the `service_role` key) bypasses RLS automatically.

```sql
-- ===================================
-- MIGRATION: 20250802_add_parsed_text_to_patient_files.sql
-- ===================================

-- 1. TABLE UPDATE
alter table patient_files
    add column if not exists parsed_text text,      -- extracted PDF content
    add column if not exists processed boolean      -- true once text extracted
        default false not null,
    add column if not exists inserted_at timestamptz default now() not null;

-- ensure each file row belongs to a consultation (cascades delete)
alter table patient_files
    add constraint patient_files_consultation_fk
      foreign key (consultation_id) references consultations(id) on delete cascade;

-- helpful index if you often look up by consultation
create index if not exists patient_files_consultation_idx
  on patient_files (consultation_id);

-- 2. RLS POLICIES
-- turn on row security (if not already)
alter table patient_files enable row level security;

-- (Re)create policies with clear names
drop policy if exists "Patients CRUD own files"          on patient_files;
drop policy if exists "Doctors read consultation files"  on patient_files;

-- Allow patient who owns the consultation to SELECT / INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE
create policy "Patients CRUD own files"
    on patient_files
    for all
    using (
        auth.role() = 'authenticated' 
        and exists (
            select 1
            from consultations c
            where c.id = patient_files.consultation_id
              and c.patient_id = auth.uid() )
    )
    with check (true);  -- same predicate

-- Allow doctors linked to a consultation to read
create policy "Doctors read consultation files"
    on patient_files
    for select
    using (
        auth.role() = 'authenticated'
        and exists (
            select 1
            from consultations c
            join doctor_consultations dc on dc.consultation_id = c.id
            where c.id = patient_files.consultation_id
              and dc.doctor_id = auth.uid() )
    );

-- Note: the Edge Function uses the service-role key, which bypasses RLS,
-- so no extra policy is required for it.

-- 3. OPTIONAL: grant storage access via PostgREST if you expose parsed_text
-- (Skip if parsed_text should remain backend-only)
```

How this maps to the workflow:

• **Edge Function** will `update patient_files set parsed_text = $text, processed = true where id = $file_id` once PDF extraction succeeds.  
• When sending docs to Gemini:  
  – For each file row where `processed = true and file_type = 'pdf'`, include `parsed_text` in prompt.  
  – For images, generate a signed URL from `file_path` and send as inline image content.

If you need further tweaks (different column names, doctor-assignment join table, etc.) just let me know!

### User Input

Perfect. I have prepared prompt templates (System Prime Prompt, Developer Prompt, Static Few-shot prompt, Auto-repair prompt). Keep a placeholder for this and i will ingest later in supabase edge functions. We are now ready to build this AI feature into our webapp. One last thing before we begin the building journey, divide this implementation plan into 3-5 small tasks. We will build each sub-task one by one, rather building all together.

*Planned for action*

### Planner Response

Here’s a clear 4-step roadmap we can tackle one by one:

1. Database & Security  
   • Apply the migration we drafted (new `parsed_text` & `processed` columns, FK, RLS policies).  
   • Verify with Supabase Studio / `supabase db push`.

2. Edge Function scaffold  
   • Create `supabase/functions/generate_clinical_summary.ts` with:  
     – Webhook handler (trigger on `INSERT appointments`).  
     – Queries that collect: profile history, consultation form_data, patient_files list.  
     – PDF-extraction helper (placeholder) and image pre-processing.  
     – Prompt-template placeholders (System / Developer / Few-shot / Auto-repair) for later insertion.

3. Gemini integration & JSON handling  
   • Add Gemini SDK call, passing assembled prompt + images/text.  
   • Validate response against Zod schema; `insert` into `clinical_summaries`.  
   • Mark `appointments.status = 'summary_ready'`.

4. Front-end & E2E  
   • In booking flow, no code change besides waiting for summary (subscription / polling).  
   • Show “Summary ready” banner + link.  
   • Run end-to-end test with dummy data; add logging/alerts.

If you’re happy with this breakdown, we’ll start with Task 1: applying the SQL migration in your Supabase project.
